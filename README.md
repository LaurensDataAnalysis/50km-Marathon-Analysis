# 50km Ultra Marathon Analysis in the Netherlands

## Introduction

This project analyzes athlete performance in 50km ultra-marathons held in the Netherlands, using a dataset covering race records from 1798 to 2022. The analysis focuses on events from 2000 onward.

## The Dataset

The Dataset can be found here: [Ultra Marathon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running)

## Background

An ultramarathon is any footrace longer than a traditional marathon (42.195 km). The 50km distance is one of the shortest ultramarathon events. This dataset provides a wealth of information on athlete performance, demographics, and event details over more than two centuries.

## Problem Statement

We aim to explore trends in athlete performance in the 50km ultra-marathon events in the Netherlands. Specifically, we investigate performance differences across genders, age groups, and seasonal conditions.

## Skills Applied

- Data Wrangling (Pandas)
- Data Visualization (Seaborn)
- Statistical Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Questions Explored

- How do performance trends differ between male and female athletes?
- Which age groups perform best in 50km races?
- How do seasons affect ultra-marathon performance?

## Insights

- **Gender Differences**: Male athletes, on average, perform faster than female athletes in 50km races.
- **Top Performers by Age**: Athletes in certain age groups consistently outperform others.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Fall is the fastest season for 50km ultra-marathon events, with Winter showing the slowest average speeds.

These insights offer valuable information for athletes, race organizers, and researchers interested in endurance sports.
